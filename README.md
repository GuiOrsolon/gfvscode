# Grails For VSCode (gfvscode)

A short suite for Development in Grails Framework on Visual Studio Code

## Features

* Automation of Commands for Grails Framework (Run-app, Create-Domain-Class, etc...)
* Organized Perspective of Files in Tree View (Future)

> **Note:** This extension does not provide additional support or additional features for the Grails Framework. It just automates commands through options. The Framework itself creates the objects and takes care of the execution of the application in Development.

## Requirements

* Have Grails Framework installed and configured.
* Have Java Development Kit installed and configured
* The %GRAILS_HOME% variable set with the Grails installation path
* The %JAVA_HOME% variable set with the Java Development Kit (aka JDK) instalation path

>**Note:** Check the JDK version and release supported by the Grails Framework version. Without this, it is possible that problems occur when getting the project's dependency files from the repositories at the time of application execution during development.w
